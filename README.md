# Solution-of-2D-heat-conduction-equation------MATLAB

This project is based on creation of 2D solver to simulate the heat conduction equation. Both Steady and Un-steady govening equations have been solved with explicit and implicit functions.

## Methods

Jacobi
Gauss - Siedel
Successive over relaxation
Crank nicolson Methods.
